In collaboration with : Vera Van de Seyp & Dora Petrova.

As the visitors face the screen, they are being filmed. The projection works like a mirror, but the faces are being covered. We intend to question the appeal raised by a vision of oneself in an exhibition space. When the visitors move to the backside of the projection, the covered faces are being exposed continuously, to everyone.
